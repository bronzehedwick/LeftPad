* Left Pad In ATS
This repo contains a literate implementation of [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/left-pad][infamous left-pad NPM module]]
to show off a few of the features of the wonderful [[http://ats-lang.org][ATS programming language.]]

~left-pad.org~ contains the full literate source and documentation. Github does
a decent job of rendering ~org~ files so you can totally read it here but for
the best results I recommend either cloning this repo and viewing
~left-pad.html~ locally or the [[https://rawgit.com/deech/LeftPad/master/left-pad.html][Rawgit link]].

While this isn't a blog post if you would like to start a discussion or just

Hope you enjoy it and I look forward to your feedback!
